# A/B Testing for Urban Wear üöÄ
This repository contains a sample A/B test design for an e-commerce platform called Urban Wear.

### Business Problem
Urban Wear, a clothing brand, is preparing to launch its new e-commerce store. Currently, the pre-launch page is focused on collecting email sign-ups from site visitors. The goal is to maximize the number of email sign-ups for the website launch.

### A/B Test Objective
As a product data scientist at Urban Wear, the goal is to design, execute, and analyze an A/B test that evaluates two versions of the email sign-up button on the pre-launch page:
Control: Blue submit button (current version)
Treatment: Green submit button
The objective is to determine whether the green button improves email sign-up rates compared to the blue button.

### Steps for A/B Testing
Load and Explore the Dataset


### Conduct exploratory analysis to understand traffic, sign-up rates, and distribution.
State the Hypothesis
1. **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: The green submit button does not improve the email sign-up rate compared to the blue button.
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: The green submit button improves the email sign-up rate compared to the blue button.

### Design the Experiment
1.**Calculate Sample Size**: Determine the minimum number of visitors needed for each group to detect a meaningful difference with statistical power (e.g., 80%).
2.**Traffic Allocation**: Split site visitors into equal groups (e.g., 50% Control, 50% Treatment).
3.**Daily Traffic Estimation**: Estimate the daily number of visitors available for the test.
4.**Experiment Duration**: Calculate how long the test should run to collect sufficient data.

### Run the A/B Experiment
Randomly assign visitors to either the control group (blue button) or the treatment group (green button).
Collect data on email sign-up rates for both groups.
Analyze the Results

### Assess Validity Threats
Ensure the integrity of the experiment by performing validity checks:
1. **AA Test**: Conduct an AA test to confirm there is no inherent difference between the control and treatment groups before starting the A/B test.
2. **Chi-Square Test for Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Run a chi-square test to check if randomization led to balanced sample sizes between groups.
3. **Additional checks like Segmentation Analysis or Novelty Checks** may be performed to identify any biases or confounding factors.

### Conduct Statistical Inference
Apply statistical tests to evaluate the results:
1. **Chi-Squared Test**: Compare proportions between the control and treatment groups (e.g., email sign-up rates).
2. **T-Test**: Compare the means of the two groups to determine if the difference is statistically significant.
3. **Confidence Interval (CI)**: Calculate a 95% confidence interval to determine the range within which the true effect lies.
