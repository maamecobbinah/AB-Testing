# A/B Testing Randomization: Best Practices and Strategy Guide

Randomization is the cornerstone of causal inference in A/B testing. Choosing the appropriate randomization strategy ensures unbiased comparisons, controls for confounding variables, and helps in obtaining statistically valid results.

## Why Randomization Matters

**Randomizing improperly can result in**
- Biased treatment and control groups  
- Confounding effects due to time, geography, or network dependencies  
- Inflated Type I/II errors  
- Misleading business decisions  

**Well-designed randomization ensures**
- Balance across test groups  
- Independence of outcomes from assignment mechanism  
- Fair attribution of treatment effects

## Key Considerations Before Choosing a Randomization Method

### 1. Data Distribution

Understanding how your outcome or key segmentation metrics are distributed helps in stratifying or blocking randomization for better balance.

| **Data Distribution**     | **Why It Matters**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Normally distributed      | Basic randomization works fine; balance is naturally achieved in large N           |
| Skewed (e.g., sales)      | Skew can lead to imbalanced groups; consider stratified or matched-pair            |
| Small sample sizes        | Random imbalance is more likely; use matched-pair or blocked                       |
| Correlated units (e.g., network or geo) | Contamination risk; use cluster randomization                         |

### 2. Experiment Type / Context

The type of experiment determines the risk of interference, bias, or imbalance.

| **Scenario**                      | **Recommended Randomization**            | **Why**                                                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| UI changes, layout tweaks        | Simple randomization                      | Low interference, cosmetic                                    |
| Pricing, conversion funnel       | Stratified                                | Segment-based differences (e.g., device, traffic source)      |
| Time-sensitive rollouts          | Blocked                                   | Prevents time-based confounding                               |
| Store or region-level impact     | Cluster                                   | Avoids contamination from geographic/social spillover         |
| Small sample, B2B, clinical      | Matched-pair                              | Boosts power with small N                                     |
| Live ML model optimization       | Adaptive / Multi-armed bandit             | Prioritizes best performers; not for causal inference         |
| Sequential deployment            | Sequential randomization                  | Operational efficiency with early stopping                    |

## Randomization Strategies and When to Use Them

| **Randomization Type**      | **What It Does**                                         | **Best for Data**              | **Best for Experiment Type**             | **Notes**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Randomization        | Randomly assigns units to groups                          | Balanced, large N              | UI tests, cosmetic tweaks                | Fast, easy, may lead to imbalance in small samples                        |
| Stratified Randomization    | Ensures balance across pre-defined strata                | Skewed or segmented            | Pricing, funnel steps, marketing         | Balances known covariates across groups                                   |
| Blocked Randomization       | Groups randomization within time or other blocks          | Time-varying                   | Campaigns, launches                      | Prevents bias due to time-based effects                                   |
| Matched-Pair Randomization  | Matches units based on covariates before assignment       | Small N, high variance         | B2B, clinical, low-traffic features      | Increases power, requires good matching                                   |
| Cluster Randomization       | Assigns entire clusters (e.g., stores) to treatment       | Correlated groups              | Store/geo-level, social networks         | Prevents spillover; reduces effective sample size                         |
| Adaptive / Bandit           | Allocates more samples to better performers               | Any                            | Optimization experiments                 | Maximizes outcome, not ideal for causal conclusions                       |
| Sequential Randomization    | Allows staged rollout with repeated evaluation            | Any                            | Rollouts, phased deployment              | Requires adjustment for repeated looks (e.g., alpha spending)            |
| Bootstrap / Resampling      | Resamples data to simulate many experiments               | Any                            | Post-analysis, estimating variance       | Not a randomization method per se, used to evaluate reliability post hoc |
